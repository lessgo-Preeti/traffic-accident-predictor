## 🔒 Important Notes

### Files NOT to Upload (Already in .gitignore):
- `*.pkl` - Model files (too large for Git)
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` - Jupyter checkpoints
- `data/sample/*.csv` - Large data files

### What Streamlit Cloud Will Do:
1. Read `requirements.txt` and install packages
2. Run your app from `dashboard/app.py`
3. First time: Models will train automatically
4. Subsequent runs: Models will be cached

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Git command not found"
**Solution**: Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution**: Use Personal Access Token instead of password
1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Use token as password when pushing

### Issue: "Models not found on Streamlit Cloud"
**Solution**: Models will auto-generate when dashboard loads. First load takes 1-2 minutes.

### Issue: "Import error on Streamlit Cloud"
**Solution**: Make sure all packages are in `requirements.txt`
