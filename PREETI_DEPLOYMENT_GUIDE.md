# Configure Git (your details)
git config user.name "Preeti Sathawane"
git config user.email "sathawanepg@rknec.edu"

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "feat: Traffic Accident Severity Prediction System - Complete ML Pipeline"

# Create GitHub repository first (IMPORTANT!)
# Go to: https://github.com/new
# Repository name: traffic-accident-predictor
# Description: ML-based Traffic Accident Severity Prediction for Indian Roads
# Keep it PUBLIC (for free Streamlit deployment)
# DO NOT initialize with README
# Click "Create repository"

# Add remote (after creating GitHub repo)
git remote add origin https://github.com/lessgo-preeti/traffic-accident-predictor.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**If password asks**: Use **Personal Access Token** instead
1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
2. Select "repo" scope
3. Copy token and use as password

## 📋 For Your Resume/Portfolio

**Project Title**:
```
Traffic Accident Severity Prediction System using Machine Learning
```

**Description**:
```
Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline to predict accident severity (Minor/Moderate/Severe/Fatal) 
using Random Forest (70% accuracy) and XGBoost. Built interactive Streamlit dashboard with 
22 engineered features specific to Indian road conditions. Deployed on Streamlit Cloud.
```

**Tech Stack**:
```
Python | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | Streamlit | Pandas | NumPy | Plotly
```

## 🎓 What to Mention in Interviews

**Q: What ML models did you use?**
A: Random Forest (70% accuracy - best model) and XGBoost (69%). I chose Random Forest as 
the primary model due to balanced performance and faster training time.

**Q: How did you handle data?**
A: Performed comprehensive EDA, cleaned 5000 records, engineered 22 features including 
time-based, weather-based, and road condition features. Removed casualties-related features 
to prevent data leakage.

**Q: What's unique about your project?**
A: It's specifically designed for Indian road conditions with features like Two-Wheeler risk 
scoring, National Highway classification, festival period indicators, and regional weather patterns.

**Q: How is it deployed?**
A: Deployed on Streamlit Cloud with an interactive dashboard where users can input real-time 
conditions and get instant severity predictions.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Issue: Git command not found**
Solution: Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win

**Issue: Authentication failed while pushing**
Solution: Use Personal Access Token instead of password (see Step 2)

**Issue: Streamlit deployment failed**
Solution: Check if repository is PUBLIC and all files are pushed to GitHub
