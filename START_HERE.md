## 📋 Resume Points (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Project Title
```
Traffic Accident Severity Prediction System using Machine Learning
```

### Description
```
Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict road accident severity 
(Minor, Moderate, Severe, Fatal) using Random Forest achieving 70% accuracy. Built 
interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions. Engineered 22 features 
specific to Indian road conditions including weather patterns, vehicle types, and 
road infrastructure. Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for public access.
```

### Tech Stack

## 💼 Interview Preparation

**Q1: Explain your project in 30 seconds**
```
I built a machine learning system that predicts traffic accident severity on Indian 
roads. It uses Random Forest achieving 70% accuracy on 5000 accident records. I 
engineered 22 features specific to India like two-wheeler risk scores and festival 
periods. The system has an interactive Streamlit dashboard deployed on cloud where 
users can input real-time conditions and get instant severity predictions.
```

**Q2: What challenges did you face?**
```
Initially, my model had 97% accuracy but I discovered data leakage - I was using 
casualty data which is known only after the accident. I fixed this by removing 
target-related features, which reduced accuracy to realistic 70% but made it 
production-ready. I also had to handle feature mismatches between training and 
dashboard, which taught me the importance of consistent data pipelines.
```

**Q3: Why Random Forest over XGBoost?**
```
Both had similar accuracy (RF: 70%, XGB: 69%), but Random Forest was 5x faster 
to train (0.3s vs 1.6s) and equally good for this use case. For production, 
faster training means easier model updates.
